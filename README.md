# Liver Tumor Classification using Deep Learning üß†üî¨

## Data Description

### Overview
The dataset for Liver Tumor Classification comprises images of liver tumors categorized into three classes: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), and normal liver tissue (Normal). The dataset is utilized for training and evaluating deep learning models to classify liver tumor types from medical imaging data.

### Classes
1. **Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)**: Images representing tumors originating from the bile duct epithelium.
2. **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**: Images depicting tumors arising from hepatocytes, the primary liver cells.
3. **Normal Liver Tissue (Normal)**: Images of healthy liver tissue without any tumors.

### Data Size
- Total Number of Images: 210
  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA): 70 images
  - Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): 70 images
  - Normal Liver Tissue (Normal): 70 images

### Data Format
- Image Resolution: Variable (dependent on imaging equipment)
- File Format: JPG, PNG, or DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)

### Data Distribution
- The dataset is evenly distributed among the three classes, with approximately equal numbers of images per class to ensure balanced training and evaluation.

### Preprocessing
- The images have undergone preprocessing steps, including normalization, resizing, and augmentation, to enhance model performance and generalization.

### Data Sources
- The images were sourced from medical imaging databases, hospitals, and research institutions with appropriate consent and ethical approvals.
- One of the leading hospitals in South India


This project aims to develop a robust deep learning model for classifying liver tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Cholangiocarcinoma,
as well as normal liver tissue. Leveraging state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG, ResNet, YOLOv8 & DenseNET the model achieves high accuracy in tumor detection and classification.

üî¨ **Objective:** Detect and classify liver tumors accurately using deep learning techniques.

üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used:** Python, Flask, TensorFlow, Keras, HTML, CSS.

üñºÔ∏è **Model Deployment:** The trained model is deployed using Flask, allowing users to upload liver images for real-time prediction through a user-friendly web interface.

üí° **Features:**
- Upload Liver Images: Users can upload liver images in various formats.
- Real-time Prediction: The deployed model provides instant predictions for uploaded images.
- Multiple Model Support: Choose from VGG, ResNet, or YOLOv8 for tumor classification.

üöÄ **Deployment:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Flask application locally or deploy it on a web server for public access.

üìä **Performance:** Achieves an accuracy of over 95% in classifying liver tumors, ensuring reliable diagnosis and treatment planning.
