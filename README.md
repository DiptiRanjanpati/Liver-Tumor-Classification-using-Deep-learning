# Liver-Tumor-Classification-using-Deep-learning

**Liver Tumor Classification with Deep Learning 🩺**

This project aims to develop a robust deep learning model for classifying liver tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Cholangiocarcinoma,
as well as normal liver tissue. Leveraging state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG, ResNet, YOLOv8 & DenseNET the model achieves high accuracy in tumor detection and classification.

🔬 **Objective:** Detect and classify liver tumors accurately using deep learning techniques.

🛠️ **Technologies Used:** Python, Flask, TensorFlow, Keras, HTML, CSS.

🖼️ **Model Deployment:** The trained model is deployed using Flask, allowing users to upload liver images for real-time prediction through a user-friendly web interface.

💡 **Features:**
- Upload Liver Images: Users can upload liver images in various formats.
- Real-time Prediction: The deployed model provides instant predictions for uploaded images.
- Multiple Model Support: Choose from VGG, ResNet, or YOLOv8 for tumor classification.

🚀 **Deployment:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Flask application locally or deploy it on a web server for public access.

📊 **Performance:** Achieves an accuracy of over 95% in classifying liver tumors, ensuring reliable diagnosis and treatment planning.
